## Structure of the code ##
The code structure is based on the MVC as well as the ECS patterns. There are three folders; `models`, `controllers` and `view` which contain all the appropriate classes for these. The `models` folder also contains a folder called `entityComponents`, and a folder called `entitySystems`, as well as the `ECSEngine`-file, following the ECS pattern. The folder `database` contains classes for sending data to the database.

## How to compile/run the project ##
Clone the project into Android Studio and connect your android device. Make sure you are in the folder named `project`, then hit the play button in Android Studio and the game will open up on your phone.
